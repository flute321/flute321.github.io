    <h2> A Collection of Rejections </h2>
    <hr>
    <h4> 
      Everyone presents the essays that worked, 
      <br> but what about the ones that <b>didn't</b> work?
      <br> Were they really all <em>that</em> bad?
      <br> Hence, introduction a collection of essays which weren't good but weren't entirely bad either.
